# `untitled-web-lang`

## Overview

This is an in-progress project to develop a modern, type-safe language with a built-in component model. The goal is provide an authoring experience that feels as smooth as React without all the friction of the meta-language React enforces.

It borrows many ideas from Rust and SwiftUI.

## Getting Started

You can run the fixtures using the `fixtures` script

```bash
./scripts/fixtures.sh
```
This will start `cargo watch` for the `fixtures` directory, specifically the `main.dan` file there.
