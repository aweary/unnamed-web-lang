# Language Overview

This document provides an overview of the language, sometimes at a high level and sometimes in detail.

## Principles

### Constraints
There is so much more you can do with constraints. Contraints are inherently about trade-offs, and we should always choose in favor of staying *more* constrained. We don't want to solve for every possible problem.

### Familiarity for JavaScript Developers

The target audience here is people building applications with JavaScript. We should make sure that the language is always accessible.




## Language Features

## Variables

You define variables with `let`.

```
let name = "Brandon";
```

You can define constants with the `const` keyword at the top-level scope of a module.


```
const name = "Brandon"
```
